= NixOS-Lima User Guide

== Intro

TBD

== Starting an instance

See the README.

=== Default Hostname

When you start a new instance using a released **nixos-lima** system image, the hostname of the guest will be `nixos`. To change the hostname, set `networking.hostName` in your NixOS configuration.

=== Instance-related Names

There are four related names that refer in various ways to an instance.

. The name of the Lima template file, e.g. `nixos.yaml` the instance was created from. Unless overridden with the `--name` option, `limactl start` will use the base name of the file (e.g. `nixos`) as the Lima instance name.
. The Lima instance name (i.e. what is displayed in `limactl list`
. The system hostname set with `networking.hostName` in the NixOS configuration.
. The name of the host configuration in `flake.nix`, e.g. `nixosConfigurations.nixos-aarch64`.

All four _could_ be the same, but in practice they are often different. It is helpful to be aware of the distinctions between them.

== Updating the NixOS Configuration of an Instance

If you have checkout out a Git repository with a Nix flake into the `/etc/nixos` directory inside your VM, you can run:

[,console]
----
$ cd /etc/nixos
$ sudo nix flake update
----

This will download updates and update  your `flake.lock` file to match the current version of the `nixpkgs` branch that you are tracking in your `flake.nix`.  (Currently `nixos-unstable` is recommended because that's what we are developing and testing on.)

After your `flake.lock` is updated you can use:

[,console]
----
$ sudo nixos-rebuild switch
----

to rebuild your system and switch to it.

== Manually Cleaning Out Old Versions

You can list your saved generations with either:

[,console]
----
$ nixos-rebuild list-generations
----

or

[,console]
----
$ nix profile history --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system
----

You can clean out links to older generations of packages by using a command like:

[,console]
----
$ sudo nix profile wipe-history --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system --older-than 30d
----

This example clears out all generations older than 30 days, but you should be careful to _not_ clean out at least your last known working version.

Once old versions are unlinked, you can reclaim storage in your Nix Store, with:

[,console]
----
 $ nix store gc
----

== Manually Cleaning Out Your Boot Partition

The file in `/boot/kernels/` are not cleaned out by `nix store gc` and I've recently manually removed them by determining which versions are old/unused and removing them with `rm` like this:

[,console]
----
$ sudo rm l4r393s77b53y2hay9qaj05dw485f87m-linux-6.13.1-Image
$ sudo rm rdg8kzlixwh9ihb6kfq56vjb60h04bri-initrd-linux-6.13.1-initrd
----

There must be a better wayâ€”I will document it when I learn it.

== Optimizing your Nix Store

This command will scan the Nix store for duplicate files and deduplicate them with hard links.

[,console]
----
$ nix store optimise
----


== Adding a GitHub Personal Access Token

I'm not sure why I had to add this; perhaps it was because my GitHub repos for my system (`/etc/nixos`) and my Home Manager (`~/.config/home-manager`) are in private GitHub repositories. I added a `github-token.nix` module that looks like this:

[,nix]
----
{ config, modulesPath, pkgs, lib, ... }:
{
  nix.settings = {
    "access-tokens" = "github.com=github_pat_YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE";
  };
}
----

and included it from `flake.nix`. This sets the `access-tokens` line in `/etc/nix/nix.conf`.
